        <h1>Fran</h1>
        <p>I'm a software engineer based in Madrid, Spain. I studied geography and I was focused on Geographic Information Systems. I love playing guitar, piano, ukulele, cajon, and basically any instrument I can make a sound with ðŸ’˜ Just for fun and mostly for the present moment. I enjoy creating things that live on the internet, whether that be websites, applications, music, or anything in between. I have been freelancing for a year now while studying and I've manage to gain a decent amount of experience and valuable knowledge from all different kinds of fields throughout my projects/work such as JS, React, CSS, HTML, NodeJS, MongoDB, Firebase, JEST, MaterialUI, Emotion, Styled Components.</p>
